# AHK-Creation-Tool

In 2019 I recorded a very dull voiced video around this GUI I created called 'AHK Creation Tool' this is a GUI front end that provides easy access to a AHK IDE (I didn't create) and AutoGUI (another tool I didn't create). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IasPfw65D1U&lc=UgzmefwDMcwAzohwLI94AaABAg&ab_channel=MyThisThat 
The files within this REPO are for general use with no warranty or liability. Use at own risk.

BEFORE USING
1. Make sure AHK is installed to the computer that is going to run AHK Creation Tool
2. Download this REPO as a .zip and extract it to your prefered location. I would create a folder under c:\ called 1.Tools and place any useful tools there such as this
3. I'd then pin the exe within this Repo to your Taskbar
4. Simply click it and it should open. Good luck.
